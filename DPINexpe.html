A) Corona Virus / Requirements from Sanitary Authorities -COVID-19- Latest News and Events (22/09/20 Update)

The data contained below has suffered no changes since previous circular

Here is a brief recap of the most important news and events with respect to COVID-19:

Compulsory isolation measures extended nationwide till October 12th-0000 hrs. Each Province, City, local District then
adopts and implements different and specific phase or restrictions in accordance with its epidemiological situation.

Borders continue with restrictions and available flights are limited since regular in/out flights not yet permitted.
Crewmembers are not allowed to disembark at different ports, so no crew change can be effected for timebeing.

Argentine Sanitary Authorities are requiring to receive in advance, copy of all documents as per National Protocol
(click here to get a copy).

Due to Uruguayan border restrictions, River Plate pilots only using the outbound vessels to position pilots at Recalada
Pilot Station. As a consequence of this, eventual delays for positioning inbound pilots could be expected if the demand
outside exceeds the number of pilots sailing on outbound vessels.

Stevedores Unions at Necochea and Bahia Blanca Ports are requesting 14 days quarantine to all vessels coming from
abroad. At Bahia Blanca Port vessels operating with gas and other products which are essential for domestic economy are
exempted. Port Administration Authorities are authorizing vessels coming from URUGUAYAN and BRAZILIAN ports to enter
port without quarantine period on a case by case basis.

be better connected during these challenging times.


B) Open Loop Scrubbers

As reported on August 13th, 2020, the Argentine Coastguard authorities released their Disposition nr 15/2020 (dated
August 08th, 2020) which came into effect on August 10th 2020. This Disposition FORBIDS the discharge of the wash waters
generated by vessel’s ‘OPEN LOOP SCRUBBERS’ (ie: open loop Exhaust Gas Cleaning Systems) IN ALL ARGENTINE jurisdictional
WATERS (including internal waters, territorial sea waters, contiguous zone and exclusive economic zone waters (as far
out as 200 nautical miles fm shore)).
Please note that closed system scrubbers may still be used but wash waters generated by these units can only be
discharged at port, employing authorized companies and their equiments, for final and proper disposal.

Furthermore, since Argentina is not a party to the MARPOL Annex VI which gives effect to the January 01st 2020 ‘Sulphur
cap’ and as there is no local equivalent legislation, vessels coming here can for now continue to use standard
specification bunkers (as the limit of 0.50% m/m does not apply locally), always provided that their respective FLAG
STATES and/or CLASSIFICATION SOCIETIES have no objections to this bunker burning procedure.

Please also refer to self-explanatory Circular as issued by local Argentine Maritime Center (click here).

We will continue to monitor any changes with respect to the above issues and we will immediately alert you in case of
need.

E) Tugboats Assistance for Mooring/Unmooring at LDC G. Lagos and Adm Agro Berths - Rosario Port

Please note and be informed that Pilots Association of Parana River has presented a letter to the Coastguard, requiring
the Assistance of Tugboats during Berthing / Unberthing manoeuvres at the port of Rosario, LDC General Lagos and Adm
Agro Arroyo Seco berths (When LDC Terminal, Liquid berth is Occupied).

In principle, Coastguard replied that Tugboats assistance is not mandatory, however leave on the consideration of the
parties involved (Pilots, Masters of the Vessels or Owners), the right to request

Tugboats, however at this stage, being pilots mentioning that the request is due to safety reasons on account of shallow
patchs located at proximities of the piers, then tugboats assistance is being required for theses berths.


F) Vessels fumigation certificate against Asian Gypsy Moth (AGM) or Japanese Gypsy Moth (JGM)

Please be informed that Argentina Maritime Center together with the SENASA authorities are working on the implementation
of the local regulations against Asian Gypsy Moth (AGM) or Japanese Gypsy Moth (JGM) in all Argentina ports. For your
guidance, the regulation will be almost the same than the one that is already in force in other countries such as Chile,
where the sanitary authority request vessel to have valid certificate of being free from the Asian Gypsy Moth (AGM) or
Japanese Gypsy
Moth (JGM) from the port were it was inspected.

We will inform final procedures once regulation finalize, officially published and date when it will be in force.


G) Lack of Profit / Port Expenses

Prior to grant loading berth, some terminals operators’ requests by writing, that vessel's agents accept their berthing
conditions / rules and penalties, in case of delays due to reasons not concerned to the terminal.
